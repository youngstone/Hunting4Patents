        " u'Description': u\"TECHNICAL FIELDThe present invention relates to an HLA-A*3303-restricted peptide, specifically a peptide comprising an amino acid sequence consisting of 9 contiguous amino acids from a WT1 protein, wherein an amino acid at position 2 of the amino acid sequence is selected from the group consisting of Ala, Ile, Leu, Val, Phe, Tyr, Ser and Asp, and an amino acid at position 9 is Arg. Furthermore, the present invention relates to a polynucleotide encoding the peptide, a pharmaceutical composition for the treatment or prevention of a cancer comprising the same, and the like.BACKGROUNDWT1 gene (Wilms' tumor 1 gene) was identified as a gene responsible for Wilms tumor which is a renal cancer in children (Non-patent Documents 1 and 2). WT1 is a transcription factor having a zinc finger structure. At the beginning, the WT1 gene was considered to be a tumor suppressor gene. However, subsequent studies (Non-patent Documents 3, 4, 5 and 6) showed that the WT1 gene rather functions as an oncogene in hematopoietic tumors and solid cancers.The WT1 gene is expressed at high levels in many types of malignant tumors. It has been examined whether or not the WT1 gene product free of mutations, which is an autologous protein, has immunogenicity in a living body. The results revealed that the protein derived from the WT1 gene which is expressed at high levels in tumor cells is fragmented through intracellular processing, the resulting peptides form complexes with MHC class I molecules, and the complexes are presented on the surfaces of cells, and that CTLs recognizing such complexes can be induced by peptide vaccination (Non-patent Documents 7, 8 and 9). It was also shown that in a mouse immunized with a WT1 peptide or a WT1 cDNA, transplanted tumor cells expressing a WT1 gene are rejected with a high probability (Non-patent Documents 7 and 10), while normal tissues expressing physiologically the WT1 gene are not damaged by the induced CTLs (Non-patent Document 7). It was shown in in vitro experiments using human cells that when Db126 peptide or WH187 peptide (amino acids 187-195 of SEQ ID No: 1, SLGEQQYSV) having a high ability to bind to an HLA-A*0201 molecule, which is one of human MHC class I molecules, is used to stimulate human peripheral blood mononuclear cells having HLA-A*0201, WT1-specific CTLs are induced, the induced CTLs have a cytotoxic activity specific for tumor cells expressing endogenously a WT1 gene at high levels, and the cytotoxic activity of such CTLs is HLA-A2-restricted (Non-patent Document 11). It was shown in in vitro experiments in human cells using WT1 peptide that matches HLA-A*2402 (which is found most frequently in Japanese people among HLA-A alleles) (WT1235; amino acids 235-243 of SEQ ID No: 1, CMTWNQMNL) that WT1-specific CTLs (TAK-1) are induced (Non-patent Document 12), and the induced CTLs do not suppress the colony-forming activity of normal hematopoietic stem cells which partially express physiologically a WT1 gene (Non-patent Documents 13 and 14). These reports strongly suggest that not only in mice but also in human beings, WT1-specific CTLs can be induced, such CTLs have a cytotoxic activity against tumor cells expressing a WT1 gene at high levels, but do not have a cytotoxic activity against normal cells expressing physiologically a WT1 gene (Non-patent Documents 7, 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14).The WT1 gene product is present as a nuclear protein, and is processed by proteasomes in cytoplasm to be fragmented into peptides. The fragmented peptides are transported into endoplasmic reticulum lumen by TAP (transporter associated with antigen processing) molecules, form complexes with MHC class I molecules, and are presented on the surfaces of cells. WT1-specific CTLs are induced as a result of recognition of WT1 peptide-MHC class I molecule complexes by CTL precursor cells via TCR, thereby exerting a cytotoxic effect on tumor cells presenting a WT1 gene product through MHC class I molecules (Non-patent Documents 7, 8 and 9). Then, it is required at least that a WT1 peptide used in cancer immunotherapy targeting a WT1 gene product is in the form that binds to an MHC class I molecule in a living body. However, MHC class I molecules are diverse and amino acid sequences of the WT1 peptides binding to respective MHC class 1 molecules are different from each other. Therefore, it is required to provide a peptide matching each subtype of MHC class I. However, only HLA-A*2402 molecule-, HLA-A*0201 molecule- and HLA-A*2601 molecule-restricted peptides are known as HLA molecule-restricted WT1 peptides to date (Patent Document 1, Non-patent Document 11 and Patent Document 2, respectively). HLA-A*3303 is present at next highest percentage to HLA-A*2402 in Japanese. Therefore, there is a need to find an HLA-A*3303-restricted WT1 peptide.Patent Document 1: WO 2003/106682Patent Document 2: WO 2005/095598Non-patent Document 1: Daniel A.

A WT1 gene is expressed in its native form at high levels, for example, in hematopoietic tumors such as leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, multiple myeloma or malignant lymphoma and solid cancers such as gastric cancer, colon cancer, lung cancer, breast cancer, germ cell cancer, hepatic cancer, skin cancer, bladder cancer, prostate cancer, uterine cancer, cervical cancer or ovarian cancer. Furthermore, an anchor motif for HLA-A*3303 is characterized in that an amino acid at position 2 is any one of Ala, Ile, Leu, Val, Phe, Tyr, Ser and Asp, and an amino acid at position 9 is Arg. Thus, in one aspect, the present invention relates to an HLA-A*3303-restricted WT1 peptide comprising an amino acid sequence consisting of 9 contiguous amino acids from a WT1 protein, wherein an amino acid at position 2 of the amino acid sequence is preferably selected from the group consisting of Ala, Ile, Leu, Val, Phe, Tyr, Ser and Asp, and an amino acid at position 9 of the amino acid sequence is preferably Arg (hereinafter referred to as a WT1 peptide).The amino acid sequence consisting of 9 amino acids comprised in the peptide of the present invention is preferably, Leu Ser His Leu Gln Met His Ser Arg (SEQ ID No: 2), Phe Ser Arg Ser Asp Gln Leu Lys Arg (SEQ ID No: 3), Ser Asp Gln Leu Lys Arg His Gln Arg (SEQ ID No: 4) or Thr Ser Glu Lys Pro Phe Ser Cys Arg (SEQ ID No: 5). Most preferably, it is Ser Asp Gln Leu Lys Arg His Gln Arg (SEQ ID No: 4). Furthermore, it may have a substitution of one to several, preferably one to five amino acids with other amino acids in the 9 amino acids of any of SEQ ID Nos: 2-5. Any one of the 9 amino acids or other substituted amino acids may be appropriately modified. In any cases, the peptide of the present invention retains an ability to bind to an HLA-A*3303 molecule.As described above, it is an object of the present invention to obtain an HLA-A*3303-restricted WT1 peptide. Thus, the peptide of the present invention may be any one as long as it comprises an amino acid sequence that is derived from a WT1 protein and consists of 9 contiguous amino acids. Thus, the peptide of the present invention may be, for example, a peptide consisting of only the amino acid sequence shown in any of SEQ ID Nos: 2-5, or a WT1 protein or a part thereof comprising the amino acid sequence shown in any of SEQ ID Nos: 2-5. Various substances may be attached at the N-terminus and/or the C-terminus of the amino acid sequence consisting of 9 contiguous amino acids in the peptide of the present invention. For example, an amino acid, a peptide or an analog thereof may be attached. If these substances are attached to the peptide of the present invention, they can be processed, for example, by an enzyme in a living body or through a process such as intracellular processing, and finally the amino acid sequence consisting of 9 contiguous amino acids can be produced and presented as a complex with an HLA-A*3303 molecule on the surface of a cell, thereby resulting in the effect of inducing a CTL. These substances may be those which modulate the solubility of the peptides of the present invention, or increase their stability (resistance to protease, etc.). Alternatively, these substances may be those which deliver the peptides of the present invention specifically, for example, to a given tissue or organ, or they may have the action to increase the efficiency of uptake by an antigen-presenting cell or the like. These substances may be those which increase the ability to induce a CTL, such as helper peptides or the like.The peptide of the present invention can be synthesized by methods generally used in the art or modifications thereof.

Amino acid sequences and the binding affinities to an HLA-A*3303 molecule of these peptides are shown in Table 1.TABLE 1Binding Amino acidaffinity Number to in SEQAmino acidHLA-A*3303PeptideID No: 1sequencemoleculeWT1337337-345LSHLQMHSR18.827(SEQ ID No: 2) WT1364364-372FSRSDQLKR15.143(SEQ ID No: 3) WT1367367-375SDQLKRHQR14.496(SEQ ID No: 4) WT1409409-417TSEKPFSCR15.310(SEQ ID No: 5) Preparation of B-LCL cellPeripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were separated by Ficoll-Hypaque gradient density centrifugation method from peripheral blood that had been collected from an HLA-A*3303-positive healthy donor (HLA-A*3303/0207). The PBMCs were then seeded to a 24-well cell culture plate at the density of about 1\\xd7107 in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FCS, and a culture supernatant of B95-8 cells (cells producing EB virus) were added. They were cultured at 37\\xb0 C. with 5% CO2 for about 1 month. B-LCL cells transformed with EB virus, which are B-cell tumor cells, were obtained. It was confirmed that the resulting B-LCL cells did not express WT1 gene. B-LCL cells were pulsed by incubating them with 20 \\u03bcg/ml of WT1337, WT1364, WT1367 or WT1409 for 2 hours, and irradiated with 80 Gy of radiation. The resulting B-LCL cells (hereinafter referred to as B-LCL cells pulsed with a WT1 peptide) were used as antigen-presenting cells for the following experiments.Induction of CTL Specific WT13\\xd7106 of PBMCs (HLA-A*3303/1101) were cultured in a 24-well cell culture plate in complete medium (450 RPMI, 45% AMI-V medium and 10% human AB serum) containing 20 \\u03bcg/ml of WT1337, WT1364, WT1367 or WT1409 at 37\\xb0 C. with 50 CO2 for 1 week to obtain responding cells. 2\\xd7106 of the resulting responding cells were cocultured with 1\\xd7106 of the B-LCL cells pulsed with the same WT1 peptide in complete medium for 1 week (first stimulation). The PBMCs were cocultured with the B-LCL cells pulsed with the WT1 peptide three more times (second to fourth stimulations) under the conditions under which 20 IU/ml (final concentration) of IL-2 was added as follows: second stimulation: two times every other day from 3 days after the initiation of stimulation; third and fourth stimulations: three times at intervals of one day from the day after the initiation of stimulation. The resulting cells were concentrated using Negative Selection Columns Gravity Feed Kit (StemSp) so that the ratio of CD8-positive T cells became about 800, and cocultured with the B-LCL cells pulsed with the WT1 peptide (fifth stimulation). CD8-positive T cells (CTLs) obtained 5 days after the final stimulation were used for measurement of the cytotoxic activity.Cytotoxic Activity of CTLThe cytotoxic activity of CTLs was measured using 51Cr release assay. CTL cells (hereinafter referred to as effector cells) were mixed at the ratio (E/T ration) of 1:1, 5:1 or 10:1 in 200 \\u03bcl of medium with target cells into which 51Cr had been incorporated, and cultured in a 96-well cell culture plate at 37\\xb0 C. with 5% CO2 for 4 hours. B-LCL cells pulsed with the same WT1 peptide as that used for induction of CTLs (BLCL-Ps), and B-LCL cells without pulsing with a WT1 peptide (BLCL-NPs) were used as target cells. After the culture, the supernatants were collected by centrifugation. The amounts of 51Cr released into the supernatants were measured using a liquid scintillation counter. The cytotoxic activity (%) was determined using the following formula: (51Cr release in supernatant of sample\\u2014Spontaneous 51Cr release)/(Maximum 51Cr release\\u2014Spontaneous 51Cr release)\\xd7100 wherein Spontaneous 51Cr release is 51Cr release observed when the target cells into which 51Cr had been incorporated were cultured alone under the same condition, and Maximum 51Cr release is 51Cr release observed when the target cells into which 51Cr had been incorporated were completely lysed using 1% Triton X-100. Results are shown in FIGS. 1-4. In the figures, longitudinal axes represent specific lysis (%), and horizontal axes represent E/T ratios. BLCL-Ps are represented using full lines, and BLCL-NPs are represented using dotted lines. It was confirmed that CTLs induced with WT1337, WT1364, WT1367 or WT1409 damage specifically BLCL-Ps presenting the WT1 peptide as a complex with an HLA-A*3303 molecule as compared with BLCL-NPs. CTLs induced with WT1364, WT1367 or WT1409 were used for further experiments below.Cytotoxic Activity of CTL Against Cell Expressing WT1 Gene EndogenouslyThe cytotoxic activity of CTLs induced with WT1364, WT1367 or WT1409 against TF-1 cells that are tumor cells expressing a WT1 gene (HLA-A*3303-positive) was determined using the method as described above. As a control, K562 cells that express a WT1 gene and are negative for HLA-A*3303 were used. Results are shown in FIGS. 5-7. In the figures, longitudinal axes represent specific lysis (%), and horizontal axes represent E/T ratios. TF-1 is represented using full lines, and K562 is represented using dotted lines. It was confirmed that CTLs induced with WT1364, WT1367 or WT1409 also have a cytotoxic activity against the cell expressing a WT1 gene exogenously.The cytotoxic activity of CTLs induced with WT1367 against B-LCL cell expressing WT1 was determined using the method as described above. The B-LCL expressing WT1 (B-LCL-WT1) refers to B-LCL cell into which a human WT1 gene is introduced and expresses a WT1 protein in the cell, and presents a peptide consisting of about 9 amino acids resulting from processing on an HLA-A*3303 molecule. As a control, B-LCL cell (B-LCL-CV) into which a control gene except a WT1 gene is introduced was used. Results are shown in FIG. 8. In the figures, longitudinal axes represent specific lysis (%), and horizontal axes represent E/T ratios. B-LCL-WT1 is represented using full lines, and B-LCL-CV is represented using dotted lines. It was confirmed that CTLs induced with WT1367 damage only the cell which is HLA-A*3303-positive and expresses WT1.Industrial ApplicabilityThe present invention provides an HLA-A*3303-restricted WT1 peptide, a polynucleotide encoding the peptide, a pharmaceutical composition comprising the same and the like.
